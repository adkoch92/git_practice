#What Makes a Good README File?

##All good README files include the following

*  ***Project Title***

	the name of the project

* ***Description***

	**Extremely** important. It should describe the project's **main purpose.** It's often helpful
to include motivations and lessons from the project.

* ***Features***

	List the project's features in this part. Don't hesitate to add screeshots, gifs, etc. to show it off

* ***IFU***

	Make sure to write step-by-step instructions on how to install and use the project. Any software
or package requirements should also be listed.

* ***Technologies***

	List all technologies and/or frameworks used and what purpose they serve in the project.

* ***Collaborators***

	Be sure to include any contributros to the project--no matter the size of the contribution.
Include collaborator names as well as links to their GitHub profiles.

* ***License***

	It's important to list a license in the README so that others will know what the project may 
or may not be used for.

	For guidance on choosing licenses for projects, [this guide](https://choosealicense.com/) may be useful.

##Equally important to the above, keep README files **brief, detailed, and up-to-date.**

***Don't forget to use Markdown to format README files for easy reading and save/include as ".md" files.
