Markdown Language
=================

Markdown language uses **basic text** and **symbols** that are deciphered by a **parser** to present output as **formatted text**

> Freely available Markdown parsers include:
> 1. StackEdit.io
> 2. Dillinger
> 3. Parse
> 4. Markdown to HTML converter
> the above demonstrates both quoted line format "> " and numbered lists "n. "
> additionally, Markdown uses the "*" symbol for bulleted lists.
> in order to simulate a nested list (list within a list), Markdown requires the addition of a new line followed by 4 spaces or 1 tab to add paragraphs between list items

While Markdown language **does not** require any specific file ending (.txt is totally fine--or literally any random file extension), **GitHub** prefers that markdown files are saved using **.md** or **.markdown** extensions.

Headers:
-------
H1 = =====
H2 = -----
Headers can also be simulated using the "#" symbol

> # H1 Heading
> ## H2 Heading
> ### H3 Heading
> ####... and so on and so forth

Emphasize (bold) = **bold text**
----------------

Bullet list = (n.)
Separate quote lines = (> )
